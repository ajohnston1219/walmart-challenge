   The following environment variables have been set.

   $MYPYTHONDIR - references your $SCRATCH/myAnaconda3/5.1.0 directory
   $MYCREATEVIRTENV [--file <venvfile>] - should only be used once to create a
virtual environment
   $MYACTIVATE - should be used whenever you want to add new Python modules
   $MYDEACTIVATE - deactivate the virtual environment

   Additionally, $PYTHONPATH is updated so your modules can be used
   with non-virtual (regular) Python.
